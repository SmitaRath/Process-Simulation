# Process-Simulation
Simulation of the different Process scheduling algorithm for FCFS, SJF and RR and compared their CPU utilization, throughput, average turn around time and waiting time.

A process, once it enters the system and before it exits it, can be either in the Ready Queue, or the I/O queue, depends on the I/O burst and CPU Burst cycle.
The time between I/O requests distributed exponentially.
